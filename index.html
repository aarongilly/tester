    <h1>Reminder for myself</h1>
    <p>I knocked this out one night after my kid went down. It's not as
        difficult as I feared. Here are the basic steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>VS Code
            <ol>
                <li>npm init</li>
                <li>in package.json > scripts, supply a "start" key with value "node index.js"</li>
                <li>npm express install</li>
                <li>add a couple routes for fun</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>GitHub
            <ol>
                <li>new repository</li>
                <li>name it whatever</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Back in VS Code
            <ol>
                <li>Source Control > Push to... > add new remote</li>
                <li>Source Control > Push to... > (newly added remote)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Glitch
            <ol>
                <li>New Project > Import from GitHub</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am and was able to debug in VS Code using the Chrome Debugging extension. 
        Set breakpoints and everything. It worked very well for a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did run into some trouble when trying to pull from GitHub to my existing 
        Glitch project, though. Glitch is giving me an error. Also it seems like it 
        just fully overwrites it every time - not ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe I can skip the GitHub step altogether and just create the new remote 
        and point it directly at the git link in the glitch app console. Although I 
        never got this working. I would just use the Glitch extension for that purpose.
    </p>
